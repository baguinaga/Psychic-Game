# Psychic-Game
A rudimentary browser-based JavaScript game.

The objective of this game is for the player to guess a randomly selected character. The player is given a set number of guesses, or "lives", until they lose. The user's input is recorded and clearly displayed on their browser. The HTML layout and CSS style will rely heavily on the bootstrap framework for styling.
